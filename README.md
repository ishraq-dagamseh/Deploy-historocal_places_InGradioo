This repository was a collaboration between me and Albaraa shehada as a team work project required from the Deep learning training from Tahaluf el-Emarate company.
In this project we applied this steps:
1. problem understand.
2. Data collection.
3. Modeling using 4 pre-trined models: Resnet50, EfficientB0, VGG16 and InceptionV3.
4. Evaluate the model performance using learning curves.
5. Build gradio App using Hugging face space.
6. Now the App is Ready to use.
